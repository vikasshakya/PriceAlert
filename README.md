#Crypto Price Alert Notification Tool

As a crypto enthusiast and investor, we always want to keep ourselves updated with the current price of our holdings. And we end up keep on refreshing the browser after every 10-15 mins.
So, to avoid this, I have written this python script, which will fetch the current price from various exchanges (Koinex, Bittrex, Ethexindia, Bitfinex, CMC) and will display a price alert notification after every 10-15 mins.
